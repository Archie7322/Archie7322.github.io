# What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

Symmetric uses a shared secret where both people or computers meet before hand. Asymmetric uses 2 numbers that are mathematically related where if you encrypt a message with one number, it can only be decrypted with the other number.

# Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

First you need to get the other person's public key, then you use the key to encrypt it and send it to them. Lastly, the other person will use their private key to decrypt the message.

# Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

Whoever has your private key will be able to decrypt any messages that are encrypted with your private key. This means that if someone else has your private key they can read any messages that someone else sends to you
